				<h2>PLEASE, CURB YOUR PET!</h2>
				<p>There is a growing problem of pet
					waste accumulation in the
					community. In order to keep your
					community clean and beautiful, as
					well as maintain the best property
					values, everyone's attention in
					addressing this problem is
					requested. Complaints are
					increasing regarding visible pet
					waste left on private property and
					common areas, including the
					neighborhood park. Therefore, all
					dog owners are reminded to pick
					up their dog's waste at all times
					and properly dispose of it and also
					to leash their dog when it is being
					walked. All residents are requested
					to immediately report instances
					where they observe dog waste not
					being removed and where dogs are
					not leashed to one of the board
					members. We are also asking that
					you take a picture of the incident.
					<strong>The board will be issuing violation noticesfor first time offenders. Thereafter, a $25.00 fine will be issued for each offense.</strong> Please, let’s
					work together to keep the Cypress
					Park Community Clean & Safe.</p>

				<h2>Upcoming Zion Referendum</h2>
				<p>The city of Zion will ask voters in
					November to grant it home-rule
					authority, which would be used to
					help address a projected budget
					shortfall and give the city more
					regulatory powers. Home-rule
					authority, which is automatically
					granted to cities with a population
					of at least 25,000, can also be
					secured through a voter
					referendum. It would allow the city
					to impose an <strong>additional salestax,
					and to raise property taxes</strong> faster
					than it otherwise would be able to
					under state law. Cypress Park is
					already paying high property
					taxes, we need to stop this
					madness. We cannot give the city
					anymore power over us. Let your
					friends and family know about the
					upcoming election. Please, when
					voting consider what is the best
					for your family and the Cypress
					Park community.</p>

				<h2>Many Hands Make <span class="yellow">Light</span> Work</h2>

					With that said, we need YOUR help
					to best manage our subdivision.
					Please consider becoming more
					active in our subdivisions activities
					and decisions. As the quote states

				<h2>Neighborhood Watch</h2>
				<p>Recently we have had several
					homeowners vehicles broken into,
					again. Here are some things you
					can do to help protect your car
					from being burglarized:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Park your car inside your garage and turn on outside lights. This will not only keep you safe when you exit the car, it will also  help keep your car safe because thieves tend to avoid areas that are highly visible.</li>
					<li> Don’t leave your car unlocked. Make sure the doors are locked and the windows rolled all the way up. If you have a car alarm or  steering wheel lock, use it. Even if you are only leaving your car for a minute, make sure it is locked.</li>
					<li>Don’t leave valuables inside your car. Take purses, wallets, laptops, gym bags, etc with you. Even if you have nothing of value  inside them, bags and briefcases are tempting targets.</li>
					<li>Watch out for suspicious activity near your car. Trust your instincts, they are usually right. Keep an eye out for cars slowly cruising your neighborhood, or people looking into parked cars.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As always, if you see something suspicious or a crime in progress, call the Zion Police, 911 or non emergency at 
					<a href="tel:8478728000" title="Call (847)872-8000" target="_self">(847)872-8000</a></p>
